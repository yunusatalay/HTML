In this code, we have added a JavaScript section that creates an array of image file names and defines a function to randomly change the image displayed in the first column of the image grid. We have also added an id attribute to the image tag so we can select it with JavaScript.

To randomly change the image, we call the changeImage function every 5 seconds using the setInterval method. The function selects the image element using the getElementById method and sets its src attribute to a randomly selected image from the images array.

To use this code, you can save it as a .html file and open it in a web browser to see the result. Make sure to replace the image file names in the images array with your own image file names. You can also modify the JavaScript to customize the image changing behavior further.
